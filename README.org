#+title: A simple air monitor with multiple sensor

+ data collect with nodemcu-32s
+ WZ-H3/WZ-H3-K for HCOH
+ SGP30 for CO2 & TVOC
+ SHT3X for humidity compensations
+ PMS7003 for PM2.5

current version is v1.1, all sensor works:

+ only test with WZ-H3(manully soldering 2.54mm pin)
+ distance between SHT3X & ESP32 module is too small, cause measured temperature much higher than actual ambient temperature.
